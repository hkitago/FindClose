# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hkitago/FindClose/refs/heads/main/Shared%20(Extension)/Resources/images/icon-48.png" height="36" valign="bottom"/> FindClose for Safari Extension

This Safari extension makes tiny close buttons on ads and overlays easier to spot. It highlights hard-to-find close icons in real time, helping you locate hidden buttons quickly and clear your screen with ease.

Ideal for anyone who prefers a cleaner, more accessible web experience. Whether small buttons are difficult to see or you simply want less visual clutter, this extension offers a calm, effortless way to manage overlays and ads.

## Installation & Uninstallation

### Installation

To install the extension on iOS or iPadOS, go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Extensions, or enable the extension by toggling it on in the Manage Extensions option found in the Safari address bar.
For macOS, open Safari, go to Safari > Settings > Extensions, and enable the extension from there.

### Uninstallation

To uninstall the extension, similarly to the installation process, toggle the extension off, or remove it completely by selecting the extension icon on the Home Screen and choosing "Delete app".

## Usage

1. Open a webpage in Safari.
2. Tap or click the icon next to the address bar and choose the extension.
3. When enabled and you encounter tiny buttons:

📱 iOS / iPadOS
- Tap a blank area of the page (avoiding links or buttons) to allow motion sensor permissions. 
  (A subtle movement of the current page indicates that motion access is enabled.)
- Shake your device gently.

💻 macOS
- Move your mouse pointer quickly back and forth (left and right).

4. Hard-to-see close buttons on ads or overlays will be highlighted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **If the permission prompt does not appear:**
> * **Tap a blank area** to re-trigger the request.
> * If that fails, **restart Safari** to reset the denied state.

> [!NOTE]
> Shake gestures are not detected during scrolling.

> [!CAUTION]
> Some close controls cannot be highlighted due to browser security restrictions or custom UI designs, such as cross-origin iframes or arrow-based controls (which is technically called Shadow DOMs).
