This Safari extension makes tiny close buttons on ads and overlays easy to spot. It highlights hard-to-find close icons in real-time, transforming the frustrating hunt for hidden buttons into an instant, effortless tap that clears your screen.

Perfect for anyone who wants a cleaner, more accessible web. Whether small buttons are difficult for you to see or tap, or you simply want less clutter while browsing, this extension gives you quick, stress-free control over intrusive content.

## Installation & Uninstallation

### Installation

To install the extension on iOS or iPadOS, go to Settings > Apps > Safari > Extensions, or enable the extension by toggling it on in the Manage Extensions option found in the Safari address bar.
For macOS, open Safari, go to Safari > Settings > Extensions, and enable the extension from there.

### Uninstallation

To uninstall the extension, similarly to the installation process, toggle the extension off, or remove it completely by selecting the extension icon on the Home Screen and choosing "Delete app".

## Usage

1. Open a webpage in Safari.
2. Tap or click the icon next to the address bar and choose the extension.
3. When enabled:

📱 iOS / iPadOS
- Tap a blank area of the page (avoiding links or buttons) to allow motion sensor permissions.
- Shake your device gently.

💻 macOS
- Move your mouse pointer quickly back and forth (left and right).

4. Hard-to-see close buttons on ads or overlays will be highlighted.
